SuDoKu
======

Version 2.0
- Able to solve hard sudoku problems
- The attached input is a random example of hard sudoku game
- Added more complex algorithm to reduce the possibility table

Gone far from the most optimal way.. can't garentee the correctness either, did not add validation tests.

Version 1.0
- Limited to file input
- Able to solve simple sudoku problems
- The attached input is said to be the HARDEST sudoku ( not sure if it's true, but I wasn't able to solve it with pen and paper yet.. )
- More complex algorithms to find answers need to be added ( concluded from my own experience of playing sudoku for years.. )
